## Overview

WREN (Web-based Runtime Environment Network) is a backend service framework designed to support interactive terminal applications and data processing workflows. The project implements a robust API layer with Python-based runtime environments for executing commands, processing data, and supporting associated frontend interfaces.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Complete backend API service for terminal and data operations
- **Python Runtime Environment**: Secure execution environment for commands
- **Real-Time Processing**: Server-sent events for streaming responses
- **Authentication System**: Secure user management and session handling
- **Database Integration**: Persistent storage for user data and session information
- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin system for custom command handlers

## Technical Architecture

### Backend
- Python-based API server
- RESTful endpoint design
- SQLite/PostgreSQL database support
- Containerized runtime environments
- WebSocket and SSE support for real-time communication

### Integration
- Compatible with frontend terminal interfaces
- API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Client libraries for multiple languages
- Deployment configurations for cloud environments

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env

# Run development server
python -m backend.app
```
